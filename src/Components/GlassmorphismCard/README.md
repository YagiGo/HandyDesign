# A Glassmorphism Card component with content fade-in effect

This is from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv0rNxr1XXk&ab_channel=OnlineTutorials
And I removed the tilting animation because that requires additional lib.

Basically using `backdrop-filter` for the glassmorphism effect. But this is not very good in terms of browser support. 

IE: No support

Chrome: 76+

Firefox: Needs to enable manually

Edge: 17
